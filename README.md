The pipex project is designed as preparation for implementing a mini_shell. It focuses on key Linux system calls such as open, close, execve, fork, pipe, dup2, and waitpid, and demonstrates fundamental Linux pipeline logic.

The bonus version extends the functionality by supporting multiple commands (multi-pipes) and implements the here document feature (here_doc), mimicking shell behavior.
